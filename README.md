# Portfolio Website

A responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects
 that I completed throughout the course of my Nano-degree program.

## Getting Started

To view the website, download a copy of the project to your local machine and open the file index.html
 with your browser. Alternatively, you can load it online from this [GitHub Pages project repository](https://daniel-234.github.io/portfolio-website/).

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - The web framework used
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - The tasks automation tool used
* [Word Cloud Generator - Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) - The tool for my word cloud images
* [SVG-edit](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit) - A SVG editor for my svg images

## Author

* **Daniele Erb√¨** - [daniel-234](https://github.com/daniel-234)

## Notes

The original main image is in 'images_src folder'. Being only 9KB, it could have been easily used in production. I preferred to
make practice using 'grunt' to automate the process of resizing that image to adapt its size to different viewports.
